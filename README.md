# PythonCode
The Python project I completed during my Data Analytics course with CareerFoundry was based on fictional data for the company Instacart. My role as a data analyst for the company was to uncover information about their sales pattern. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

## Key Questions
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e. the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
5. The marketing and sales teams are partiularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. I chose to answer the following questions:
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customers loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's family status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's age?
- Is there a connection between age and spending power?

The data sets provided in this project were fabricated and provided by CareerFoundry. The data provided contained the following sets:
- Customers
- Departments
- Orders
- Orders_products_prior
- Products

## Tools
The following Python libraries were used for this project:
- Pandas (for data analyzation)

- SciPy (for mathematical equations)

## Folders
The project files were divided between the following folders:
- Project Management (project brief)
- Data (data files removed prior to uploading folders due to size)
- Scripts (Jupyter notebooks containing codes for analysis)
- Analysis (visualizations used for developing and explaining insights)
- Sent to Client (final Excel report)
